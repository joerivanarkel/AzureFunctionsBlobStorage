## AzureFunctionsBlobStorage
In this example I am using Azure Functions to fetch and read files from Azure Blob Storage using Azure Functions. 

### Blob Trigger
A blob trigger activates when a blob is uploaded to an container. Here i use ``Stream`` as the trigger attribute. When reading a file the trigger is used as a input binding, but when uploading a file it used as the output binding. The connectionstring cane easily be found in the local-settings.json file, which is created with the Blob trigger function.
```csharp
[Blob("{BLOB-FILEPATH}",FileAccess.Write,Connection = "{CONNECTIONSTRING}")]
```

### Http Trigger
When creating a file, I've used an HTTP trigger as it's input binding. When uploading text to a new file, you can use ``Textwriter`` as the trigger attribute. Otherwise using ``Stream`` is the most logical to use.
```csharp
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "post", Route = null)]
```
